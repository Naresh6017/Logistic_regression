# Logistic_regression
Repo contains code and tutorials for logistic regression (very important concept for anyone trying to learn deep learning)

Much of the code in this repo is inspired from the course "Deep Learning Prerequisites: Logistic Regression in python" at udemy by LazyProgrammer. I would like to take this chance to thank him for his immense contributions to the field. 

Some of the examples are added as pratice projects in the repo
